PHONEBOOK
APPLICATION

-INTRODUCTION-

Our Objective: To create
a digital phone book that
allows users to store,
manage, and retrieve
contact information
efficiently.

-FUNCTIONS-

INSERT Contacts: Users can
add new contact details
including name, phone
number, address, and email.

UPDATE Contacts: Existing
contact information can be
updated.

Delete Contacts: Users can
remove contacts that are no
longer needed.

Search Contacts: A search
functionality to quickly find
contacts by name or other
details.

DISPLAY Contacts: Users can
view all their contacts in
alphabetical order.


-Challenges-

One challenge was creating a linked database
and
ensuring data integrity
when multiple users
accessed the application
simultaneously.
so we implied a Linked list solution


-Conclusion-

This application simplifies
contact management and
can be a valuable tool for
both personal and
professional use
but for future modifications
We plan to add features like
contact grouping,
import/export functionality,
and integration with other
applications
